# DJnner

DJnner is a JUCE framework(c++) based DJ application designed for new beginners. <br>
DJnner allows users to modify the speed and volume as the music plays. <br>
It also creates the waveform display once the music file is loaded. <br>
I also added a memo space on the screen for the users.
